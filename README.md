This application reacts to screen size to work on Mobile and Desktop alike. Created with MeteorJS and MongoDB.

# Concept
The idea behind this application is that a challenge image will appear on the screen, you must then resolve the challenge (depending on if itâ€™s an image, a riddle, or emoji's). Once you think you have discovered the location you must go there and find and scan a QR code. This will complete your challenge and you shall move onto the next.

This application was designed to get people walking, exercising and interacting with the world.
